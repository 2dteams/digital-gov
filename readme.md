pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the application you can either use the flask command or pythonâ€™s -m switch with Flask. Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable:
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```
If you are on Windows, the environment variable syntax depends on command line interpreter. On Command Prompt:
```
set FLASK_APP=app.py
```
